About: The assignment covers three units of the OOP course. The task is to create a user defined singly linked list (SLL) class that can function with the provided user class to reproduce the basic functions expected of a SLL, like adding, removing, and index nodes in the list. A NUnit tester was implemented to ensure that the created class would preform as outlined in the skeleton provided. Finally, methods were added to serialize and deserilze the SLL into the JSON format.
